# Agont

Agont is a web based app made by the request of my father for an alarm system (yes I know) coding this at 3 am just because why not!

The entire thing works and is on the web: https://agont2.netlify.app/

# How to use

THe app is pretty simple to use you just set up a time for your alarm with the dropdowns and click set alarm (which is in green) then once the alarm is over clikc the red button that says 'clear alarm' and the alarm sounds will go away.

Thank you!
